# sentiment_analysis
Note : Supports only Ubuntu
Using latest modules of python and works from scratch for building an integrated environment for sentiment analysis

This compact environment combines all some (may be under development) aspects of twitter data mining .

To run the apllication : 
(i) Copy all the files on the desktop .
(ii) Open terminal . 
(iii) In terminal , type "bash ./Desktop/comm.txt" without quotes .
(iv) Type in the relevant information when asked .

And voila ! tweet_stream.py starts streaming live tweets on the entered topic and saves it in a txt file which is by default appears on the desktop .
